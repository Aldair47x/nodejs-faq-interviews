<h1>♛ Nodejs FAQ interviews repository ♛ </h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Having a tracking log list for all the questions, projects and stuff for over the interviews of Nodejs. </p>

- What is NodeJs? 
<pre>Nodejs is a very popular scripting languaje that is primarily used for a server-side scripting requirements</pre>

- What is the difference between  Nodejs and JavaScript? 
<pre>Javascript is the entirely programming language and Node Js is a scripting language as interpreter of Javascript</pre>

- Can you briefly explain the working of Nodejs? 
<pre>Nodejs is an entity that runs in a virtual environment, using Javascript as the primary scripting language.
It uses a simple V8 environment to run on, which helps in the provision of features like the non-blocking I/O and a single-threaded event loop</pre>

- Where is Nodejs used? 
<pre>Nodejs is used in a variety of domains. But, it is very well regarded in the design of the following concepts:
- Network application 
- Distributed computing
- Responsive web apps
- Server-Client applications </pre>

- What is the difference between Nodejs and Angular? 
<pre>Nodejs is used in:
- Situations where scalability is a requirement
- Ability to generate queries in a database 
- Mainly used to develop small/medium-sized applications 
- Provides many frameworks such as Sails, partial, and express

Angular is used in:
- Best fit for the development of real-time applications 
- Ability to simplify an application into the MVC architecture
- Mainly used to develop real-time interactive web applications 
- Coded in TypeScript </pre>

- Why is Nodejs single-threaded? 
<pre>Nodejs works on the single-threaded model to ensure that there is support for asynchronous proccesing.

With this, it makes it scalable and efficient for applications to provide high performance and efficiency under high amounts of load.</pre>

- What is the meaning of control flow function? 
<pre>The control flow function is a common code snippet, which executes whenever there are any asynchronous function calls made

They are used to evaluate the order in which these functions are executed in Nodejs</pre>

- Why is Nodejs so popular these days? 
<pre>Nodejs has gained an immense amount of traction as it mainly uses Javascript. It provides programmers with the following options:
- Writing Javascript on the server
- Access to the HTTP stack
- TCP and other protocols
- Direct database access
</pre>

- What is an event loop in Nodejs? 
<pre>The working of an event loop begins with the occurrence of a callback wherever an event begins. This is usually run by a specific listener. Nodejs will keep executing the code after the functions have been called, without expecting the output prior to the beginning.</pre>
